# Basics of Clustering Methods for Linguistic Data

UC Berkeley Society for Linguistics Undergrad Students (SLUgS)
Eric Wilbanks - March 32, 2022

These materials cover the basics of commonly-used clustering algorithms and how they are relevant to asking questions of linguistic data. No experience with coding or statistics is required for this workshop, but basic Python knowledge is helpful to work through the extensions.


## What's Included?
- Day-Of Materials:
	- slide version: clustering_linguistic_data.slides.html
	- Jupyter Notebook: clustering_linguistic_data.ipynb

- Materials with Extension Questions filled in:
	- slide version: clustering_linguistic_data_answers.slides.html
	- Jupyter Notebook: clustering_linguistic_data_answers.ipynb

## Using these files?
You can follow along using the static version of the workshop materials using the slides. 

If you want to run the code interactively, you will need to have a working [Jupyter installation](https://jupyter.org/install).

If you're working through the workshop in person, a good option is to download the file and then run it on your [https://datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu) account. (If you're not familiar, you can find more information about this resource [here](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/users/services.html).)

## Dependencies
If you are running the Jupyter notebook, you'll want to be sure the following python packages are installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

If you get a warning message when attempting to import any of these, you can install them via pip using a command such as the following on the command line:

```
pip install scikit-learn
```
